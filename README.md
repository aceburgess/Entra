## Entra

An application and hardware setup with Raspberry PI to help you manage virtual keys to let guests into your apartment building.
It allows you to assign access and is meant to be used in tandem with our hardware setup and code written for Raspberry Pi, which grants remote access to apartment buildings with older intercom systems.

Site is hosted currently at: http://entra.herokuapp.com

Code for the raspberry pi can be found at: [entra-raspberrypi-code](http://github.com/aceburgess/entra-raspberrypi-code)
